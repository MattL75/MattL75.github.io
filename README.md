# Personal Website

Repository for my personal website, which serves as a digital resume. 

I initially started this project early 2019 before my graduation, but only now (late 2020) decided to finish it. Mostly because I was bored.

It's still in progress, but almost done :)

## Running Locally

1. Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Install the Angular CLI by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
3. Navigate to the repository.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. Run `ng serve`.
6. Visit `localhost:4200`.

## Building

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Deploying

Run `ng deploy` to deploy the site to github pages.
